# musical-bingo

Musical bingo is a simple PHP script I made to make it easy to generate fully random cards that
could be used.

## Usage

To use this script you have to fill the file songs.txt with all the songs that you will use. Each
song has to be seperated by a newline (`\n`).

When you open `index.php` in your browser, you can enter the ammount of cards that you would like
to generate. Each card will be printed on a seperate page.

## Permissions

You have my permission to do whatever you want with these files. Just be nice and let me know if
you do so.
